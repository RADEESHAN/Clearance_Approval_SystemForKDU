this is a clearance approval system for KDU. i developed this as a my project and currently developing that for kdu. so this system has multiple user categories.

01. students.
02. admin. -add new users to the system like MA, HOD ..
03. Head of the department(HOD).
04. Management Assistant(MA). Add each department students to the system. and get the list of approved students and get as a excel sheet.
05. Assistant Registrar (AR).
06. Assistant Bursar (AB).
07. Adjutant officer - give the final approval for the students.

First Admin can add the authorized persons to the system like HOD, MA..
then MA Can add the students to the system of each departments.

when a student wants to a clearance from the university he can log in the the system with his given username and passwords(MA emails them).
after the login students, they can apply a clearance from filling the form details. 
After the submission. the system navigate student clearance for approval of the HOD, librarian, AR officer, AB officer and Adjutant officer.
When they approve or reject that update the database when all the parties have given their approval or rejection it comes to the adjutant approval he check the others and give the final decision of clearance is approve or reject. when he take that action then email go to the 
students' given email (I used SMTP mail service for that).

management assistant can search and filter each student details for his/her works that help for her.

MA can download the final approved student list as a excel sheet for his/her future purposes.



Please i request to download the zip file and paste the project inside the htdocs directory in xampp file. and with a browser search also add the given database to phpMyAdmin.
